# The IDEAFast Feasibility Portal

## Usage

The project is meant to be used as part of a Docker/Kubernetes container deployment. At present these container are not yet published and we invite you to look at the developer setup below.

## Local development

### Requirements

First things first, there's always something before you can start.

To make our life easier, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) a lot. Make sure you have it installed.

This software requires both MongoDB and MinIO to be available. Follow the installation guidelines for these software directly from their respective websites:
- [https://docs.mongodb.com](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- [https://docs.min.io](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html)

Both software also have easy to start docker images available for convenience.

### Install dependencies and build the project

Building the library is easy. First run `yarn install && yarn build`, to build the application. The current application is built ontop of a system called ICL-ITMAT-Broker comprised of multiple components including :

- itmat-commons
- itmat-docker
- itmat-interface
- itmat-job-executor
- itmat-setup
- itmat-ui-react

### Add configuration

You will need to provide database and object store connection details and will have the ability to customised other paramters. We typically recommend that you configure your secrets.

```bash
cp packages/itmat-interface/config/config.sample.json packages/itmat-interface/config/config.json
cp packages/itmat-job-executor/config/config.sample.json packages/itmat-job-executor/config/config.json
```
These config files need to be editted accordingly for Mongodb database (`database{ }`) and MinIO (`objectStore{ }`).

`nodemailer{ }` in `packages/itmat-interface/config/config.json` is also required to configure for email service.

### Initialise mongodb with seed data

```bash
yarn setupDatabase
```

### Start developing

Once all that is done, you only need to use `yarn start` to start the software in development mode.
